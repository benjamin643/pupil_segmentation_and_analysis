# pupil_segmentation_and_analysis

This repository contains code that was used to create a segmentation pipeline from video that captures pupil response to augmented tests inside headset goggles. 


* Example Folder

The example folder is included here with a video that is capturing pupils during the bright test administered inside a set of goggles. The goggles and test were designed by Ocular Data Systems, Inc. The company provided this exampled video so that we may provide any interested parties with the ability to see how our segmentation pipeline was utilized. It should be noted that this test video had slight variations compared to the videos used in our research. For example, the test is longer and the video captured is of a different size. Therefore, some of the parameters in the example pipeline were modified slightly to capture the eyes in the video but the overall outline and functionality is the same. Below, we provide a brief description of the example folder contents.
